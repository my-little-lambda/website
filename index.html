    <p>A book on functional programming by Richard Torruellas</p>

    <h2>About the book</h2>
    <p>We will be writing functions, and a lot of them. Small, predictable functions. We will test them. We will see how we
      can make programs that are manly made up of functions. We will combine them to make new functions. We will have fun.</p>

    <p>So, if you're checking out this book, you might already have an idea of what functional programming is. Either way, I
      think you will get something from this book. We will be gradually going through many of the "major" FP concepts. Going
      through these concepts should allow you to take these ideas to your current project, regardless of language.</p>

    <p>We will be mostly using JavaScript throughout this book. Although JavaScript is not considered a <em>pure</em> functional
      language, it is actually quite capable of implementing most of the concepts. Later in the book we will go over what
      a <em>pure functional language</em> is, but for now, lets focus on the things that will bring value to you <em>today</em>.</p>
